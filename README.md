# Synthetic-Data-Project

This research focuses on generating high-quality synthetic data for Industrial Control Systems
(ICS) datasets and proposes an evaluation framework for selecting the most suitable method. The
aim is to create realistic and diverse datasets while preserving privacy and addressing biases.
The comparative analysis reveals strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of different synthetic
data generation techniques for ICS datasets. The findings aid in selecting appropriate methods,
enabling further research and algorithm development in a privacy-preserving environment. This
research contributes to advancing ICS understanding, enhancing capabilities, and improving the
robustness and security of ICS systems.
